This is an experiement provisioning Django 1.5.1 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Sentry, Nginx, and uWSGI

I'm currently using CentOS 6.4 host with VirtualBox 4.1.2 and an Ubuntu Server guest installed with the Ubuntu Server i386 iso.
The hostsfile assumes you can get to the VirtualBox guest at 127.0.0.1:2222

If you'd like to try to use this, I recommend a 'grep -nri fdavis' from the root directory.
You'll likely want to change every instance of fdavis, because that is not very likely to be the username you use everywhere! :P
Patches to switch over to Vagrant are welcome! (I intend to to this at some point.)
